# Stock-Portfolio

---

## Update
As of March 17th 2018, the stock_quote gem no longer uses the Google Finance API, as Google has terminated public access to its API. Thus, this app is no longer working until further notice.

This is a stock portfolio application created with Rails and React. For the live site, you may use (username/password: holla@you // asdfasdf) to view seed data.

* Ruby version: 2.3.1
* BCrypt authentication
* Uses stock_quote gem (with Yahoo! Finance API)
* Uses stocksearchapi for search functionality (currently down, sorry!)
* Uses chartkick gem

User Stories:
* I would like to have an account that stores all my portfolios and stock positions
* I would like to see how each portfolio is performing individually
* I would like to see the individual stock positions of each portfolio
* I would like to be able to sell stock from the portfolio page
* I would like to be able to search for stocks and see information about them
* I would like to buy stocks and choose which portfolio to put them in
* I would like to see color coded gains and losses for better readability
* I would like to have charts and graphs displaying historical data of my portfolio

Stretch Goals:
* I would like a dynamic web page that update with buy and sell fields without leaving the page
